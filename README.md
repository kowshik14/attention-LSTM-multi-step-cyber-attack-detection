## Abstract
In recent years, the intensive usage of electronic devices has increased threats to the stability of massive amounts of information generated by billions of users every second. To counter such threats, an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** plays a key role. In this paper, an attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model is proposed for detecting multi-step cyber-attacks in networks. Our model combines **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** units with an **Attention layer** and employs **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** for feature selection, resulting in a 72.73% reduction in features and a 3x reduction in computational time while improving detection rates by over 1%. The model outperforms traditional classifiers on the same dataset, showing improved results across multiple metrics.
